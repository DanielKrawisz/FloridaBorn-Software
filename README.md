Was it built or updated at the South Florida Citadel? 
We want to keep track of things that get produced here 
for archival sake, and to take stock of the value of 
co-working and open source development. 

## What are we working on?!

Feel free to make a pull request and add a link to anything you have built, updated or contributed to at the Citadel!
